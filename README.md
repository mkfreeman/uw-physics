# University of Warsaw Physics Department Talk

These resources were used in [Michael Freeman's](http://mfviz.com) talk on _Visualizing Concepts: Using Data to Explain Complex Topics_ at the University of Warsaw, as sponsored by the Inter-Country Fulbright grant. View the live resources [here](http://mfviz.com/uw-physics).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
